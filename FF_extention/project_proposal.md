1. Project Overview & Motivation
   Geoﬀrey Hinton’s Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm introduces a biologically plausible
   alternative to backpropagation by utilizing two forward passes, one with positive (real) data
   and one with negative (generated) data. While the initial results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are
   promising, the foundational paper leaves several architectural and mathematical design choices
   largely unexplored.
   This project aims to systematically investigate three specific open questions regarding the FF
   algorithm's objective functions, activation layers, and spatial processing capabilities. If time
   permits, we will also explore the concept of "sleep" (oﬄine negative data processing) to further
   model biological learning.
2. Project Objectives:
   1. Optimize the Goodness Function: Transition from maximizing the sum of squared
      activities for positive data to alternative formulations, experimenting on many alternatives, specifically evaluating the minimization of unsquared activities on positive data (and maximizing on negative
      data).
   2. Explore Novel Activation Functions: Replace standard Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs)
      with alternative non-linearities. The primary focus will be implementing an activation
      function based on the negative log of the density under a t-distribution, and also many other potential functions
   3. Implement Local Goodness Functions for Spatial Data: Instead of a single global
      goodness score per layer, we will divide layers into spatial blocks (inspired by Löwe et
      al., 2019) that independently calculate goodness. This aims to drastically accelerate the
      learning rate for image data.
   4. Investigate "Sleep" Phases (Stretch Goal): Attempt to decouple the positive and
      negative passes temporally, training on positive data while "awake" and using the
      network's own generations to train on negative data while "asleep"
      .
3. Implementation Plan
   Week 1: Baseline Setup & Goodness Function Variations
   ●
   Tasks:
   ○
   ○
   ○
   Replicate a baseline FF multi-layer network (in PyTorch) and achieve the
   paper
   's ~1.36% error rate on the MNIST dataset.
   Implement alternative goodness functions.
   Crucial Implementation Detail: When using unsquared activities, modify the layer
   normalization to normalize the sum of the activities rather than the sum of their
   squares (as noted in the paper's footnotes).
   Week 2: Activation Function Engineering
   ●
   Tasks:
   ○
   ○
   ○
   Implement custom activation layers.
   Formulate the mathematical forward pass and local derivatives for the negative
   log of the density under a t-distribution.
   Train the network using these new activations and compare stability and
   convergence speed against the ReLU baseline.
   Week 3: Localized Goodness for Spatial Data
   ●
   Tasks:
   ○
   ○
   ○
   Adapt the network architecture for spatially structured data (e.g., using localized
   receptive fields without weight sharing).
   Divide the hidden layers into sub-grids/blocks. Force each block to individually
   use the length of its pre-normalized activity vector to distinguish between
   positive and negative data.
   Test this on CIFAR-10 and jittered MNIST to see if local constraints inject
   information into the weights faster than a global constraint.
   Week 4: Evaluation, Ablation, & "Sleep" (Stretch Goal)
   ●
   Tasks:
   ○
   ○
   Consolidate results into a final comparative analysis (ablation study of what
   combinations of goodness/activation/spatial-locality work best).
   Stretch Goal: Modify the training loop to alternate between thousands of positive
   updates (wake) and negative updates (sleep). Experiment with low learning rates
   and high momentum to prevent catastrophic forgetting or network collapse
   during the "sleep" phase.
4. Evaluation Methodology
   ●
   ●
   Datasets: We will use MNIST (standard and spatial-permutation invariant) and
   CIFAR-10 to allow for direct comparisons against the benchmarks established in
   Hinton's paper.
   Evaluation Metrics:
5. Test Error Rate (%): To measure if the generalizations improve or degrade.
6. Convergence Speed: Measured in the number of epochs (and raw wall-clock
   time) required to reach a specific error threshold. We expect the local goodness
   functions (Objective 3) to significantly reduce required epochs.
7. Expected Outcomes
   By the end of the month, this project will yield a comprehensive empirical study of the
   Forward-Forward algorithm's flexibility. We will determine whether replacing ReLUs with
   statistical density functions or other funtions, altering the goodness metrics, and enforcing spatial locality can
   make FF a more competitive alternative to standard backpropagation in computer vision tasks.
